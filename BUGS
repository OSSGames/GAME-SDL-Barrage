SDL does not clear the return key properly when starting the game
from a terminal. Simply press Return to update its state.

SDL does not properly get curser position if switching from 
fullscreen to Window and back. It's stuck to wrong 640x480 from
window mode not allowing to reach the far end of the shooting range.
No workaround known. Just decide whether to play in fullscreen or
window and stick to it.
