%description
Barrage is a rather violent action game with the objective to kill
and destroy as many targets as possible within 3 minutes. The player
controls a gun that may either fire small or large grenades at
soldiers, jeeps and tanks. It is a very simple gameplay though it is
not that easy to get high scores.
