How To Install Barrage:

1)     Get SDL and SDL_mixer from http://libsdl.org.
       Note: If you decide to install packages rather than the
       source, make sure to install the separate DEVEL packages
       as well, else you won't be able to compile the game.

2)     Depending on wether you want to install the game to the
       system or run it locally in your home directory you'll have to:
       
       2.1) become root and run './configure; make; make install'
       2.2) run "configure --disable-install; make;"

       Both times you can apply the additional option --disable-audio
       to the configure script to compile completely without sound.

3)     Run the game by typing 'barrage' in a terminal (2.1) or enter
       the subdirectory 'src' and run the binary 'barrage'. (2.2)
       Note, that you can pass some arguments to barrage, explained in
       the README.

4)     If you extracted the source you can build an RPM by running 
       'configure; make rpm'. If you do not want to unpack the 
       source use 'rpmbuild -ta barrage-1.0.1.tar.gz' to get an RPM
       directly from the tarball.
